independent personal pronoun forms</span> <span class="c9">for the
three persons in both singular and plural, e.g. French
(singular)</span> <span class="c10">moi, toi, lui/elle,</span>
<span class="c9">(plural)</span> <span class="c10">nous, vous,
eux/elles</span><span class="c9">.</span></p><p class="western c11"><span class="c9">But in some languages, there is</span> <span class="c12">person syncretism</span><span class="c9">, i.e. there is a
form in the paradigm of independent personal pronouns that serves
for more than one person. (Alternatively, one could say that the
forms for two different persons are homonymous.) This is
cross-linguistically unusual and therefore of particular interest.
An example of 1st/2nd person syncretism in the plural is <a href="/contributions/49">Haitian Creole</a></span> <span class="c10">nou</span> <span class="c9">'we,
you (</span><span class="c13">pl</span><span class="c9">)', and an
example of 2nd/3rd person syncretism in the plural is <a href="/contributions/56">Seychelles Creole</a></span> <span class="c10">zot</span> <span class="c9">'you
(</span><span class="c13">pl</span><span class="c9">), they'.
In</span> <span class="c10">APiCS</span><span class="c9">, person
syncretism occurs only in the plural, in line with the well-known
generalization that the singular tends to make more grammatical
distinctions than the plural (<a class="ref-link" data-content="greenberg1966" style="cursor: pointer;">Greenberg 1966</a>: 27, <a class="ref-link" data-content="croft2003" style="cursor: pointer;">Croft 2003</a>:
95-96).</span></p><p class="western c11"><span class="c9">Some languages also have other forms of syncretism, such as
number syncretism (lack of singular-plural distinction, as in
Standard English</span> <span class="c10">you</span><span class="c9">) or gender syncretism (lack of masculine-feminine-neuter
distinction, as in English</span> <span class="c10">they</span><span class="c9">, contrasting with the
distinction between</span> <span class="c10">he, she</span>
<span class="c9">and</span> <span class="c10">it</span>
<span class="c9">in the singular). In this chapter, only person
syncretism is considered.</span></p><p class="western c15"><span class="c14">This chapter distinguishes three types of languages (with

The extension of</span> <span class="c10">u(nu)</span> <span class="c9">to the first person may be related to the fact that some West
